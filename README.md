## Environment Overview

My pentest environment consists of Burp Suite Community Edition running through Chrome. To start my enviornment I am using a bash script that starts Firefox and Burp when I type "setdev" into the terminal. To type "setdev" and not "./setdev.sh", I created an alias in my .bashrc script.
