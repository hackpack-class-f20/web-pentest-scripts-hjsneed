I chose the Inspect Me website. I had Burp running and started by opening dev tools in Chrome. I checked the robots.txt in the url but no file was found. Inspecting his javascript file, I found the comment "/* I learned JavaScript! Here's part 3/3 of the flag:  ". In his css file I found 
/* I learned CSS! Here's part 2/3 of the flag: ct0r_g4dget_098df0d0} */ and in his html file I found 	<!-- I learned HTML! Here's part 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{ur_4_real_1nspe -->". While I did not need Burp to solve this, I need to get more comfortable traversing through webpages using dev tools so this was a good exercise. It is also evident that the decision to use Chrome instead of Firefox for my hacking environment was a good idea given the utility of dev tools.
